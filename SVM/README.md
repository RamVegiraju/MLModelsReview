# **Pros/Cons**

## Pros

- Very effective with **highly dimensional data**.
- Works extremely well when there is a **clear margin of separation**.
- Effective when there are **more dimensions than number of samples**.
- **Outliers have less of an impact** as the hyperplane is affected only by the support vectors.


## Cons

- **Selecting an appropriate kernel** can be computationally expensive/need to know the dataset very well to be able to pick the right kernel.
- Can take a large amount of **time** with a large dataset.
- Struggles with performance when there is a lot of **overlap between the target classes** or noise in classification problems.
