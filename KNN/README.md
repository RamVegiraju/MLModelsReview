# **Pros/Cons**

## Pros

- A **lazy-learning algorithm**, no actual training step, new data is simply tagged to a majority class, based on historical data. Very easy to understand and implement.
- Can be used for **both** classification and regression.
- Only one **hyper-parameter**: k value.
- **Non-parametric**, makes no assumptions about the data/parameters
    - Parametric: Assume statistical distributions in the data, several conditions need to be met (Ex: Linear Regression)
    - Non-Parametric: Makes no assumptions about data distribution/conditions for the data to meet.
