# Pros & Cons Decision Trees

## Pros

- Do not need to **scale** and **normalize** data
- Handles **missing values** very well
- Less effort in regards to **preprocessing**

## Cons

- Very **prone to overfitting**
- Sensitive to **outliers and changes in the data**
- Takes a long **time to train** and expensive complexity wise
- Weak in terms of **regression**

# Pros & Cons Random Forest

## Pros

- Performs well on **imbalanced data**
- Works well with **high dimensionality** and handling a **large amount of data**
- **Decorrelates trees,** can deal with problem of variance
- Solves **classification and regression issues**

## Cons

- Need to have **predictive power** with the **features** otherwise it is inefficient
- Can be a **black box**, hard to interpret
